C is a  machine independent language. 

"c": "cd $dir && gcc $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt", 

C program execution steps 

 

Pre processing-> Compilation -> Assembly -> Linking 

 

Pre Processing 

 

Removes Comments and expands macros. 

 

Include the contents of header files. 

 

.i file contain preprocessed output which step 1 of C file execution. 

 

Compilation 

 

It convert the preprocess .i file into .s file which is assembly file. 

 

.s file get converted into .o file which is machine level insturnction. 

 

 

Linking 

 

It links all the .o file for execution. 

 

gcc -Wall -save-temps Hello_World.c -o vishal 

 

This command will creates the files that we discussed above.

But you can't perform operation or instruction out of the scope.
